# -32-bit-Brent-Kung-Adder-using-VHDL-
To illustrate the Operations of tree adders, the architecture over here is described by Brent and Kung for a tree adder. In this adder, we compute the P and G values in a tree fashion.
where P=Ai*Bi and G=Ai(xor)Bi : A and B are the inputs of the adder.
Using these values we can generate next P and G values in atree fashion.
